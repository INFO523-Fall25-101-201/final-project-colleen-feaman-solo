## High Level Goal

Build a book recommendation system that finds similar books using metadata (author, genres, subgenres, description/keywords) and optionally adjust suggestions using the reader's ratings (e.g., down-weight authors/genres from 1-star books).

## Expanded Description

I am an avid reader that uses platforms, like Goodreads, to find new books. Any reader knows the frustration of finishing an amazing book and entering the dreaded "slump" of not knowing what good book to pick up next. Most recommendations provided by apps like Goodreads, push overly popular titles rather than personalized suggestions.

I want to create a transparent, content-based model that recommends books using metadata with an optional rating-based adjustment so the system can learn from reader preferences. For example, if a user consistently gives low ratings to books from a particular author or sub-genre, the model will avoid similar recommendations in the future. I want the focus of this system to be on content similarity over popularity.

## Datasets

This dataset contains rich metadata about books from the Goodreads list "Books That Everyone Should Read At Least Once". It includes 10,000 books and each book has the author, description, genres, average rating, number of ratings, and a URL link to the book page on Goodreads.

```{python}
#| label: load-dataset1
#| message: false
#| output: true

```

This dataset consists of three CSV's that contain user-book ratings. This data will be used to recommend new books to the user based on their reading history.

```{python}
#| label: load-dataset2
#| message: false
#| output: true

import pandas as pd

books_path = "data/user_data/Books.csv"
ratings_path = "data/user_data/Ratings.csv"

books = pd.read_csv(books_path, sep=";", encoding="latin-1", on_bad_lines="skip")
ratings = pd.read_csv(ratings_path, sep=";", encoding="latin-1", on_bad_lines="skip")

print("Books:", books.shape)
print("Ratings:", ratings.shape)
```

## Repo Organization

This repository follows a structured layout with dedicated folder for data, analysis, and rendered output. Each primary folder includes a README.md to describe the contents and purpose of the folder.

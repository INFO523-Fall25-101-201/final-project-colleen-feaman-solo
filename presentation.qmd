## Project Overview

Goal: Build a hybrid book recommendation system that combines:

-   Content- Based Filtering (TF_IDF)

-   Collaborative Filtering (item-based KNN)

-   Hybrid Scoring (weighed combination

Motivation: Give readers recommendations based on what they like to read

-   Similar books

-   Rating patterns

## Data Sources

1.  Books Metadata
    -   Title
    -   Author
    -   Publisher
2.  Ratings
    -   Implicit 1-10 ratings
    -   ISBN
    -   User ID

## Data Cleaning

Books

-   Removed duplicate ISBN's

-   Normalized text (lowercase, strip, fill missing)

-   Constrained publication year

-   Dropped ISBNs with no metadata

Ratings

-   Removed zeros (viewed page, not rated)

-   Kept on books that exist in the Books data

-   Filtered low-activity users/books

## Content-Based Model (TF_IDF)

```{python}
Book_Title + Book_Author + Publisher
```

-   Max features = 20,000

-   ngram_range = (1,2)

-   stop_words = "english"

-   strip_accents = "unicode"

-   min_df = 2

Sparse matrix:

147,100 x 20,000

## Content Similarity: Example Output

*plot*

## Collarboative Filtering (Surprise KNN basic)

Surprise library:

-   built for recommender systems

-   handles sparse ratings efficiently

-   Auto maps raw IDs to internal integer IDs

Model Specification:

-   Item-based similarity

-   Cosine distance

-   KNNBasic

-   Trained on full dataset

## Collaborative Filtering Recommendation Example

*plot*

## Hybrid Model

*Formula*

Default: a=0.6 (content weighted slightly more)

Ensures results when:

-   a book has a sparse rating history (CF weak)

-   Metadata alone isnt enough (content weak

Output

-   Top-N combines recommendations ranked by hybrid score

## Conslusions

## Code

```{python}
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
import statsmodels.api as sm
import pandas as pd

# Fit a linear regression model
X = mtcars[['speed']]
y = mtcars['mpg']
model = LinearRegression().fit(X, y)

# Summary of the model
X2 = sm.add_constant(X)
est = sm.OLS(y, X2)
est2 = est.fit()
print(est2.summary())
```

## Plots

```{python}
penguins['species'] = penguins['species'].apply(lambda x: "Adelie" if x == "Adelie" else "Other")
sns.scatterplot(data=penguins, x='flipper_length_mm', y='body_mass_g', hue='species')
plt.show()
```

## Plot and text

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Some text

-   goes here
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
```{python}
#| warning: false
#| fig.width: 5.5
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(5.5, 5.5 * 0.618))
sns.boxplot(data=penguins, x='bill_length_mm', y='species', hue='species', ax=ax)
plt.show()
```

# A new section...

## Tables

If you want to generate a table, make sure it is in the HTML format (instead of Markdown or other formats), e.g.,

```{python}
penguins.head().to_html()
```

## Images

## Math Expressions {.smaller}

You can write LaTeX math expressions inside a pair of dollar signs, e.g. \$\\alpha+\\beta\$ renders $\alpha + \beta$. You can use the display style with double dollar signs:

```         
$$\bar{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i$$
```

$$
\bar{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i
$$

Limitations:

1.  The source code of a LaTeX math expression must be in one line, unless it is inside a pair of double dollar signs, in which case the starting `$$` must appear in the very beginning of a line, followed immediately by a non-space character, and the ending `$$` must be at the end of a line, led by a non-space character;

2.  There should not be spaces after the opening `$` or before the closing `$`.

# Wrap up

## Feeling adventurous?

-   You are welcomed to use the default styling of the slides. In fact, that's what I expect majority of you will do. You will differentiate yourself with the content of your presentation.

-   But some of you might want to play around with slide styling. Some solutions for this can be found at https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs.

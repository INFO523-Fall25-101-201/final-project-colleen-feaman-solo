## Project Overview

Goal: Build a hybrid book recommendation system that combines:

-   Content- Based Filtering (TF_IDF)

-   Collaborative Filtering (item-based KNN)

-   Hybrid Scoring (weighed combination)

Motivation: Give readers recommendations based on what they like to read

-   Similar books

-   Rating patterns

## Data Sources

1.  Books Metadata
    -   Title
    -   Author
    -   Publisher
2.  Ratings
    -   Implicit 1-10 ratings
    -   ISBN
    -   User ID

## Data Cleaning

Books

-   Removed duplicate ISBN's

-   Normalized text (lowercase, strip, fill missing)

-   Constrained publication year

-   Dropped ISBNs with no metadata

Ratings

-   Removed zeros (viewed page, not rated)

-   Kept books that exist in the Books data

-   Filtered low-activity users/books

## Content-Based Model (TF_IDF)

-   Max features = 20,000

-   ngram_range = (1,2)

-   stop_words = "english"

-   strip_accents = "unicode"

-   min_df = 2

Sparse matrix:

147,100 x 20,000

## Content Similarity: Example Output

*plot*

## Collarboative Filtering (Surprise KNN basic)

Surprise library:

-   built for recommender systems

-   handles sparse ratings efficiently

-   Auto maps raw IDs to internal integer IDs

Model Specification:

-   Item-based similarity

-   Cosine distance

-   KNNBasic

-   Trained on full dataset

## Collaborative Filtering Recommendation Example

*plot*

## Hybrid Model

*Formula*

Default: a=0.6 (content weighted slightly more)

Ensures results when:

-   a book has a sparse rating history (CF weak)

-   Metadata alone isnt enough (content weak

Output

-   Top-N combines recommendations ranked by hybrid score
